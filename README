KasikiTest - Getting the right key length
#########################################
14 May 2012

Kasiki Test is an python script applying the Kasiki Test method ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination )
in order to guess the key length of text encrypted with polyalphabetic substitution ciphers like Vigenere.

Once the key length is known letter frequency distributions can be used to gues the rihgt password. (See https://github.com/mapa17/VigenereCrack)

Usage
=====
KasikiTest must be called with the encrypted text and the maximum length of repeating patterns to be looked for.

python3 KasikiTest.py [CipherFile] [maxPatternLength]

e.g.
For guessing the Key length of the cipher text C1.txt and to look for the repetition of patterns not longer than
ten letters.

python3 KasikiTest.py ../../CriptoCompeticion/TextosConcurs/C1.txt 10
Distance Histogram for [../../CriptoCompeticion/TextosConcurs/C1.txt]

The results show that there are a few patterns of length 10 that keep repeating and the dividors of their
distances are 5,6,7,105,10, ...
The second number in each tuple states the number of times the divider was found in the distances
e.g For patterns of length three the divider 6 was found 38 times, the divider 5 occured 35, ...


Bugs
====
Well, time will tell ...
